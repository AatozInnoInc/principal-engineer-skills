# Principal Software Engineering Skills

A collection of skills that are essential for engineering at the highest levels.

# Philosophy

## <i>"an inch wide and a mile deep."</i>

It's simply overwhelming how many tools, rules, skills, commands, and subagents exist. At a certain point, their value is subject to dimishing returns due to the sheer volume of it. 10 well-used skills are far more valuable than 100 general skills. The promise we make is to deliver high quality, precision tools with very specific directions so you know exactly how and when to use them.

# How to use

Think of these as a multi-purpose tool. They have specific use-cases. When applied correctly, they work very well. When used incorrectly, results may vary. A flathead screwdriver may still work on a philips head screw, but it is less effective and may damage the screw in the process. Every skill has a specific name and descripton to help you understand what it does and when to use it.

# Roadmap

There are roughly 10 repeatable, precise ways that I use agents in my workflow, and once I fully recognize how to translate them into a skill in a reliable, repeatable way, I will add them as skills to this repo. Rough plan:

1. ✅ <a href="skills/summarize-git-changes/SKILL.md">Summarize Git Changes</a>
1. ☐ Precision Planning
1. ☐ Iterative, Gated Development
1. ☐ Disaster Recovery (for when Agents get stuck on one or many problems/errors)
1. ☐ SOLID Compliance
1. ☐ Thorough Research
1. ☐ ?
